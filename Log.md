**Today's Progress**: I've gone through a question on GFG and same problem on Leetcode.

**Thoughts** I solve the same problem on gfg and leetcode but I got stuck on one thing as the code I was trying on GFG does not run on leetcode as the question was same I know we have to change the solution acc. to the parameters given in the question I did so but after watching the discussion section I saw that many of the peeps have applied the same solution and got all test cases passed but I was getting TLE , don't know the reason but after struggling a lot I got my code run properly.

### Day 4: December 10, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through a question on Leetcode.

**Thoughts** I solve the same problem on leetcode but face lots of difficulty solving this as  I was not able to perfectly solve this as I know there is an inbuilt function to solve this question that's why I have to take help of Striver's video to understand the concept throughly.
